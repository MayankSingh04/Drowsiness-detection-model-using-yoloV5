Drowsiness Detection Model Using YOLOv5: A Comprehensive Approach to Driver Safety
Fatigue and drowsiness while driving are critical causes of road accidents globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), drowsy driving significantly increases the risk of accidents, injuries, and fatalities. To address this, drowsiness detection systems have emerged as an innovative solution, combining machine learning, computer vision, and advanced object detection algorithms to monitor drivers' states and provide real-time alerts.

This project presents a state-of-the-art Drowsiness Detection System leveraging YOLOv5, one of the fastest and most accurate object detection models, to analyze driver behavior in real time. The system monitors facial cues, particularly the eyes, to detect signs of drowsiness and fatigue. It uses real-time image processing techniques to ensure swift and accurate alerts when the driver’s attention level drops.




Project Overview: Enhancing Road Safety with AI
The core goal of this project is to develop a reliable, real-time system that can detect when a driver is becoming drowsy. Drowsiness manifests through physical cues like slower blink rates and longer eye closures, which this system aims to capture and interpret. By leveraging YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once, version 5) for object detection, the model detects facial landmarks and determines if the driver’s eyes are open, closed, or partially closed. Using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) metric, the system assesses drowsiness by analyzing the duration of eye closure.
